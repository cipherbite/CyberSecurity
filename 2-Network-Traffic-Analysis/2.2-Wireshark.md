## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Wireshark is a widely used network protocol analyzer that lets you see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

## Familiarity with Wireshark <a name="familiarity-with-wireshark"></a>

Wireshark has a rich feature set that includes deep inspection of hundreds of protocols, live capture, offline analysis, and even VoIP analysis. Features also include decryption support for many protocols, such as IPsec, ISAKMP, Kerberos, SNMPv3, SSL/TLS, WEP, and WPA/WPA2.

**Command:**

```sh
wireshark -k -i eth0
```
````

**Purpose:** This command starts Wireshark and begins capturing packets on the `eth0` interface.

## Advanced Usage <a name="advanced-usage"></a>

Wireshark provides advanced capabilities for analyzing network traffic and diagnosing anomalies. Below, we explore how to dissect FTP (File Transfer Protocol) traffic.

### Analyzing FTP Traffic in Wireshark

FTP is commonly used for transferring files over a network.

1. **FTP Dissector**:
   - **Command:**
     ```sh
     ftp.request.command
     ```
   - **Purpose:** Shows any commands sent across the FTP control channel (port 21). We can look for information like usernames and passwords with this filter. It can also show us filenames for any files requested.

2. **FTP-Request-Command Filter**:
   - **Command:**
     ```sh
     ftp.request.command
     ftp-data
     ```
   - **Purpose:** Reveals commands sent across the FTP control channel (port 21), including usernames, passwords, and filenames requested by clients. Views data transferred over the FTP data channel (port 20). Filtering on specific conversations captures all data sent during that session.

## Decrypting RDP Connections <a name="decrypting-rdp-connections"></a>

Wireshark can decrypt Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections if provided with the necessary encryption keys.

### Investigating RDP Traffic

RDP encrypts its data using TLS, but with the correct keys, Wireshark can decrypt this traffic.

**Scenario:** Investigating RDP traffic in an incident response scenario.

1. **Command:**
   ```sh
   wireshark -k -i eth0 -Y rdp
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command captures RDP traffic. RDP typically uses port 3389. Utilize the display filter `tcp.port == 3389` to identify any RDP traffic.

2. **Apply the decryption key in Wireshark**:
   - Provide the RDP key to Wireshark so it can decrypt the traffic.
   - Go to Edit → Preferences → Protocols → TLS.
   - On the TLS page, select Edit by RSA keys list. A new window will open.
   - [![import-rdp.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tTdFmb3K/import-rdp.png)](https://postimg.cc/KkzKRdsf)
   - **Import the RDP key:**
     - Click the + to add a new key.
     - Type in the IP address of the RDP server (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
     - Type in the port used (3389).
     - Leave the Protocol field as `tpkt` or blank.
     - Browse to the server.key file and add it in the key file section.


### RDP In The Clear

Once the key is applied, perform an analysis of the RDP traffic. Follow TCP streams, export any potential objects found, and carry out other necessary investigations. This analysis works because the RSA key used for encrypting the RDP session has been acquired.

Once the key is applied, perform an analysis of the RDP traffic. Follow TCP streams, export any potential objects found, and carry out other necessary investigations. This analysis works because the RSA key used for encrypting the RDP session has been acquired. The steps for acquiring the key can be lengthy, but essentially, the RDP certificate from the server allows OpenSSL to retrieve the private key.
