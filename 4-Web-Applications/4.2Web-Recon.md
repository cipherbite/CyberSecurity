## Introduction to Web Reconnaissance

Web Reconnaissance or Web Recon refers to the process of gathering information about a target domain or IP address which can include server details, services running, softwares and versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Nmap Scanning Techniques

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool for network discovery and security auditing. It's essential for detecting open ports and running services. 

**Basic Command:**
```bash
nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
```

This command performs an OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

**Advanced Usage:** Using Nmap to perform a stealth SYN scan, avoiding detection by most firewall configurations.
```bash
nmap -sS -T4 -p- 192.168.1.1
```

This command scans all 65535 ports stealthily, using only SYN packets.

## Using TheHarvester for Data Collection

**TheHarvester** is used to gather open source intelligence (OSINT) about an organization, which can include emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs.

**Example Command:**
```bash
theharvester -d example.com -b google
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

This command searches Google for domain-related data including emails which belong to example.com.

## Directory Enumeration with DirBuster

**DirBuster** searches for hidden directories and files on a server. It is a crucial tool for understanding the web structure and finding potentially unprotected assets.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
dirb http://example.com /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

This command uses a wordlist to brute force directory paths on the target domain.

## Leveraging Shodan for-wide Scanning

**Shodan**, often described as the "search engine for hackers", scans the entire internet and provides information on devices, servers, and their vulnerabilities.

**Basic Search Example:**
```
"apache" country:"US"
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

This Shodan query finds all Apache servers located in the United States.

## Combining Tools for Enhanced Recon

Effective web reconnaissance often involves using these tools in combination to gather as much data as possible. Each tool's output can inform the inputs for the others, creating a comprehensive picture of the target's attack surface.

## Advanced Web Recon Strategies

Explore complex strategies such as **passive DNS replication**, using API data from Shodan for automated monitoring, or scripting Nmap scans to run in sequence with DirBuster for dynamic input.
