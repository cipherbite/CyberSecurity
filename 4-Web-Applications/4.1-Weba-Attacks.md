## Introduction to WebSockets

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, facilitating real-time data transfer between clients and servers. Understanding WebSockets is fundamental for securing applications that rely on this technology.

## WebSocket Analysis in Burp

**Burp Suite** is a powerful tool for testing WebSocket communications. To monitor WebSocket traffic:

1. Navigate to the Proxy -> Options tab.
2. Under WebSocket interception rules, add a new rule to intercept messages.

```plaintext
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

## Exploiting XSS via WebSockets

**Example:** Basic XSS through WebSocket:

```javascript
// Client-side script that sends a malicious message
websocket.send("<script>alert('XSS')</script>");
```

This simple example shows how XSS can be injected via WebSocket messages if inputs are not sanitized before display.

## Exploiting SQLi via WebSockets

**Example:** Basic SQL Injection via WebSocket:

```sql
// WebSocket message containing SQL code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ' " + userInput + " ';
```

Ensure that values transmitted over WebSockets are properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH)

Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking occurs when an attacker hijacks a WebSocket connection using a user's credentials. Preventing CSWH involves checking the Origin header in WebSocket handshake requests to ensure requests are coming from expected domains.

## WebSocket Attacks: Tools & Prevention

Regularly using tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite** for testing can help identify vulnerabilities in WebSocket implementations. Employ strict origin checks, validate input data, and ensure authentication tokens are managed securely.

## Advanced WebSocket Attack Techniques

**Advanced Example:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) using proxy tools to modify WebSocket traffic.

1. Setup **OWASP ZAP** as a proxy server.
2. Intercept and modify WebSocket frames to inject payloads or alter messages.

```plaintext
// Interception Script to modify WebSocket frames
function interceptedMessage(clientMessage) {
    return clientMessage.replace("Hello", "Hacked");
}
```

This script, when set up in a proxy environment, demonstrates an advanced attack vector where the content of legitimate WebSocket messages is altered.
