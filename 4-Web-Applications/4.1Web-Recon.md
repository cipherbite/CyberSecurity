## Introduction to Web Reconnaissance

Web Reconnaissance or Web Recon refers to the process of gathering information about a target domain or IP address which can include server details, services running, softwares and versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Nmap Scanning Techniques

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool for network discovery and security auditing. It's essential for detecting open ports and running services.

**Basic Command:**

```bash
nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
```

[![tracerout.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3JYrf7gy/tracerout.png)](https://postimg.cc/Z0sh0GsZ)

This command performs an OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

For GitHub or any professional documentation intended to impress advanced penetration testers with the power and versatility of Nmap for web enumeration and penetration, you can use the following two commands:


For your GitHub portfolio, you can provide a more sophisticated Nmap scan that balances performance and thoroughness, ensuring it highlights depth in detection capabilities. Here is an improved version:

2. **Vulnerability Detection with NSE Script and Service Detection**

   Enhance your vulnerability detection by combining Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE) with comprehensive service detection. This setup scans a broader range of ports and includes more script categories to uncover a wide spectrum of potential vulnerabilities.

   ```bash
   nmap -p 20-5999 -A -T4 --script=vuln,default,banner --open -v --reason <ip>
   ```

   Description:
   - `-p 80,443`: Scans the common web service ports (HTTP and HTTPS).
   - `--script http-vuln-*,vuln,cve`: Executes a broad set of vulnerability detection scripts including:
     - `http-vuln-*` for HTTP-related vulnerabilities.
     - `vuln` for general vulnerability detection scripts.
     - `cve` for scripts targeting specific known vulnerabilities listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.
   - `-sV`: Enables service version detection, important for identifying exact versions of services running.
   - `-O`: Attempts OS detection, providing insights into the operating system of the target.
   - `-T4`: Sets a faster execution speed with a balance between performance and stealth.


## Using TheHarvester for Data Collection

**TheHarvester** is used to gather open source intelligence (OSINT) about an organization, which can include emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs.

**Example Command:**

```bash
theharvester -d example.com -b google
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

This command searches Google for domain-related data including emails which belong to example.com.

## Directory Enumeration with DirBuster

**DirBuster** searches for hidden directories and files on a server. It is a crucial tool for understanding the web structure and finding potentially unprotected assets.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
dirb http://example.com /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

This command uses a wordlist to brute force directory paths on the target domain.

## Leveraging Shodan for-wide Scanning

**Shodan**, often described as the "search engine for hackers", scans the entire internet and provides information on devices, servers, and their vulnerabilities.

**Basic Search Example:**

```
"apache" country:"US"
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

This Shodan query finds all Apache servers located in the United States.

## Combining Tools for Enhanced Recon

Effective web reconnaissance often involves using these tools in combination to gather as much data as possible. Each tool's output can inform the inputs for the others, creating a comprehensive picture of the target's attack surface.

## Advanced Web Recon Strategies

Explore complex strategies such as **passive DNS replication**, using API data from Shodan for automated monitoring, or scripting Nmap scans to run in sequence with DirBuster for dynamic input.
