## Introduction to Web Reconnaissance

Web Reconnaissance, or Web Recon, is the practice of systematically collecting data about a specified domain or IP address. This includes identifying server specifics, operational services, software configurations, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Nmap Scanning Techniques

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is a foundational tool for network mapping and security auditing, vital for identifying open ports and active services.

**Example Command:**

```bash
nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
```

**Visuals:**

[![Nmap Traceroute Visualization](https://i.postimg.cc/3JYrf7gy/tracerout.png)](https://postimg.cc/Z0sh0GsZ)

The above command provides OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

**Advanced Command for Vulnerability Detection:**

```bash
nmap -p 20-5999 -A -T4 --script=vuln,default,banner --open -v --reason <target-ip>
```

[![Nmap Advanced Scan Output 2](https://i.postimg.cc/2jTY8tqM/advNmap2.png)](https://postimg.cc/2jTY8tqM)

This command showcases thorough scanning with refined techniques for deep vulnerability detection.

## Data Collection with TheHarvester

**TheHarvester** aids in the gathering of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on organizations, collecting data such as emails, domains, subdomains, and more.

**Example Command:**

```bash
theHarvester -d kali.org -l 500 -b duckduckgo
```

In this setup:
- `-d`: Domain to search.
- `-l`: Limit to 500 results.
- `-b`: Data source (DuckDuckGo).

**Another Use Case:**

```bash
theHarvester -d kali.org -b all -v -n -c -t -f my_report
```

In this command:
- `-d kali.org`: Target domain.
- `-b all`: Use all available data sources.
- `-v`: Verbose output for more detailed information.
- `-n`: DNS brute force mode.
- `-c`: DNS TLD check.
- `-t`: Perform DNS TLD expansion.
- `-f my_report`: Save results to a file named `my_report`.

## Directory Enumeration using DirBuster

**DirBuster** is instrumental in discovering hidden directories and files, crucial for mapping web structures and identifying unsecured assets.

**Usage Example:**

```bash
dirb http://example.com /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

[![dirb1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Gpg9ZpF3/dirb1.png)](https://postimg.cc/d7dqCwNg)

This method utilizes a wordlist for brute-forcing directory paths.

## Leveraging Shodan for Internet-wide Scanning

**Shodan** scans the entire internet, unveiling data about devices, servers, and potential vulnerabilities, catering to security researchers and professionals.

**Quick Search Example:**

For example, we can find devices that have port 445 open (indicating SMB usage), do not require authentication (potentially vulnerable), are located in Canada, and contain the term "Documents." By combining these filters, we narrow the results to specific devices meeting our criteria.
