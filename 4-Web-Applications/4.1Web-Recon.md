## Introduction to Web Reconnaissance

Web Reconnaissance or Web Recon refers to the process of gathering information about a target domain or IP address which can include server details, services running, softwares and versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Nmap Scanning Techniques

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool for network discovery and security auditing. It's essential for detecting open ports and running services.

**Basic Command:**

```bash
nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
```

[![tracerout.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3JYrf7gy/tracerout.png)](https://postimg.cc/Z0sh0GsZ)

This command performs an OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

For GitHub or any professional documentation intended to impress advanced penetration testers with the power and versatility of Nmap for web enumeration and penetration, you can use the following two commands:


For your GitHub portfolio, you can provide a more sophisticated Nmap scan that balances performance and thoroughness, ensuring it highlights depth in detection capabilities. Here is an improved version:

2. **Vulnerability Detection with NSE Script and Service Detection**

   Enhance your vulnerability detection capabilities by combining Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE) with comprehensive service detection. This advanced setup performs an extensive scan across a broader range of ports and leverages multiple script categories to uncover a wide spectrum of potential vulnerabilities.

   ```bash
   nmap -p 20-5999 -A -T4 --script=vuln,default,banner --open -v --reason <ip>
   ```

   ![advNmap2](https://i.postimg.cc/2jTY8tqM/advNmap2.png)

   **Description:**
  
   - `-p 20-5999`: Scans ports in the range 20-5999, covering both well-known and custom port ranges.
   - `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
   - `-T4`: Sets a faster execution speed with a balance between performance and stealth.
   - `--script=vuln,default,banner`: Executes vulnerability detection scripts, default scripts, and banner grabbing scripts to gather extensive information.
   - `--open`: Shows only open (or possibly open) ports.
   - `-v`: Increases verbosity level, providing a more detailed output.
   - `--reason`: Displays the reason Nmap considers a port to be in a particular state.

This command demonstrates an advanced use of Nmap to thoroughly scan a target while maintaining a balance between speed and comprehensiveness. By employing various scripts and techniques, it effectively identifies multiple types of vulnerabilities and provides detailed insights into the target's services and potential weaknesses.  


Sure, I can help reorganize the information. Here's a revised version:

## Data Collection Using TheHarvester

**TheHarvester** is a tool used for gathering open source intelligence (OSINT) about an organization. The data it can collect includes emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs.

### Example Command

```bash
theHarvester -d kali.org -l 500 -b duckduckgo
```

In this command:
- `-d` specifies the domain to search.
- `-l` limits the results to 500.
- `-b` specifies the data source (in this case, DuckDuckGo).

## Using restfulHarvest

The `restfulHarvest -h` command shows the help message and exits. 

In this command:
- `-H HOST` specifies the IP address to listen on (default is 127.0.0.1).
- `-p PORT` specifies the port to bind the web server to (default is 5000).
- `-l LOG_LEVEL` sets the logging level (default is info but [critical|error|warning|info|debug|trace] can be set).
- `-r` enables automatic reload used during development of the API.


## Directory Enumeration with DirBuster

**DirBuster** searches for hidden directories and files on a server. It is a crucial tool for understanding the web structure and finding potentially unprotected assets.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
dirb http://example.com /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

_![DirBuster Command Screenshot](URL_to_image)_

This command uses a wordlist to brute force directory paths on the target domain.

## Leveraging Shodan for-wide Scanning

**Shodan**, often described as the "search engine for hackers", scans the entire internet and provides information on devices, servers, and their vulnerabilities.

**Basic Search Example:**

```
"apache" country:"US"
```

**Screenshot Placeholder:**

_![Shodan Search Example Screenshot](URL_to_image)_

This Shodan query finds all Apache servers located in the United States.

## Combining Tools for Enhanced Recon

Effective web reconnaissance often involves using these tools in combination to gather as much data as possible. Each tool's output can inform the inputs for the others, creating a comprehensive picture of the target's attack surface.

## Advanced Web Recon Strategies

Explore complex strategies such as **passive DNS replication**, using API data from Shodan for automated monitoring, or scripting Nmap scans to run in sequence with DirBuster for dynamic input.
