## Introduction to Web Reconnaissance

Web Reconnaissance, or Web Recon, is the practice of systematically collecting data about a specified domain or IP address. This includes identifying server specifics, operational services, software configurations, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Nmap Scanning Techniques

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is a foundational tool for network mapping and security auditing, vital for identifying open ports and active services.

**Example Command:**

```bash
nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
```

**Visuals:**

_[![Nmap Traceroute Visualization](https://i.postimg.cc/3JYrf7gy/tracerout.png)](https://postimg.cc/Z0sh0GsZ)_

The above command provides OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

**Advanced Command for Vulnerability Detection:**

```bash
nmap -p 20-5999 -A -T4 --script=vuln,default,banner --open -v --reason <target-ip>
```

_[![Nmap Advanced Scan Output 2](https://i.postimg.cc/2jTY8tqM/advNmap2.png)](https://postimg.cc/2jTY8tqM)_

This command showcases thorough scanning with refined techniques for deep vulnerability detection.

## Data Collection with TheHarvester

**TheHarvester** aids in the gathering of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on organizations, collecting data such as emails, domains, subdomains, and more.

**Example Command:**

```bash
theHarvester -d kali.org -l 500 -b duckduckgo
```

In this setup:
- `-d`: Domain to search.
- `-l`: Limit to 500 results.
- `-b`: Data source (DuckDuckGo).

## Directory Enumeration using DirBuster

**DirBuster** is instrumental in discovering hidden directories and files, crucial for mapping web structures and identifying unsecured assets.

**Usage Example:**

```bash
dirb http://example.com /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

This method utilizes a wordlist for brute-forcing directory paths.

## Leveraging Shodan for Internet-wide Scanning

**Shodan** scans the entire internet, unveiling data about devices, servers, and potential vulnerabilities, catering to security researchers and professionals.

**Quick Search Example:**

```
"apache" country:"US"
```

**Visual Placeholder:**

This query efficiently locates Apache servers within the US.

## Combining Tools for Enhanced Reconnaissance

Employing a synergistic approach by integrating outputs and capabilities of various tools ensures comprehensive reconnaissance and deeper security insights.
